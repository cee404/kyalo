# Kyalo — Web Development Project

Simple static website project containing a small multi-page site.

## Project Overview

- A lightweight static website with pages: homepage, products, about, and contact.
- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and static assets in the `images/` directory.

## Files

- `index.html` — Homepage
- `products.html` — Products listing
- `about.html` — About page
- `contact.html` — Contact page
- `style.css` — Site styles
- `images/` — Image assets used by the site

## Setup & Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.

2. For a simple local server (recommended), from the project root run one of the following:

   - Using Python 3:

     python -m http.server 8000

     Then open http://localhost:8000

   - Using Node (serve):

     npx serve .

## Development Notes

- Keep styles in `style.css`. Pages are plain HTML — no build step required.
- Add images to the `images/` folder and reference them with relative paths.
